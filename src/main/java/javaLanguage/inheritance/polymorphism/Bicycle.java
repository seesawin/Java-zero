     * What You Can Do in a Subclass
     * <p>
     * A subclass inherits all of the public and protected members of its parent, no matter what package the
     * subclass is in. If the subclass is in the same package as its parent, it also inherits the
     * package-private members of the parent. You can use the inherited members as is, replace them, hide them,
     * or supplement them with new members:
     * <p>
     * 1)The inherited fields can be used directly, just like any other fields.
     * 2)You can declare a field in the subclass with the same name as the one in the superclass, thus hiding it (not recommended).
     * 3)You can declare new fields in the subclass that are not in the superclass.
     * 4)The inherited methods can be used directly as they are.
     * 5)You can write a new instance method in the subclass that has the same signature as the one in the superclass, thus overriding it.
     * 6)You can write a new static method in the subclass that has the same signature as the one in the superclass, thus hiding it.
     * 7)You can declare new methods in the subclass that are not in the superclass.
     * 8)You can write a subclass constructor that invokes the constructor of the superclass, either implicitly or by using the keyword super.
     * 9)The following sections in this lesson will expand on these topics.
     * <p>
     * Private Members in a Superclass
     * <p>
     * A subclass does not inherit the private members of its parent class. However, if the superclass has
     * public or protected methods for accessing its private fields, these can also be used by the subclass.
     * <p>
     * A nested class has access to all the private members of its enclosing classâ€”both fields and methods.
     * Therefore, a public or protected nested class inherited by a subclass has indirect access to all of
     * the private members of the superclass.
